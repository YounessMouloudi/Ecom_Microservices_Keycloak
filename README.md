# About Project

This is a web application for managing products, customers, and orders, built using **Spring Boot** for the backend and **Angular** for the frontend. It follows a **microservices architecture**, with separate services for each domain **(products, customers, and orders)**. The application is styled using **Bootstrap 5** for a responsive design. **Keycloak** is used for **authentication** and **authorization**.
The app provides a user-friendly **CRUD interface** to manage products, customers, and orders, with role-based access control to ensure secure usage. The frontend communicates with the backend via **RESTful APIs**, and Keycloak handles user authentication and permissions.
